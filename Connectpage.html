      <p3>Overview</p3> <br><br>

      <p8>Project Brief</p8> <br><br>

      <p7>Loneliness can be defined as ‘the gap between someone’s desire for connection and the reality of their connections.’
        The goal of our project was to account for how different groups in society are affected by loneliness, identify the group we
        would like to target, and design a way to reduce its impact.
      </p7>

      <br><br>

      <p8>The Problem</p8> <br><br>
      <p7>Loneliness affects many members of society; however, undergraduate and graduate students experience loneliness in unique ways.
        Often times, moving away from home and entering a new environment comes with many challenges. Additionally, there are many factors
        and pressures placed on students that can lead to feelings of loneliness </p7>
      <br><br>
      <p8>The Goal</p8> <br><br>
      <p7>Through our project we aimed to identify the unique factors and pressures on college age students that lead to loneliness and design
        a way to reduce its impact. </p7>
      <br><br>

      <p8>The Process</p8> <br><br>

      <center><img src="img/connectpage/theprocess.png" style="width:100%"></center>
      <br><br>

      <center><p14>Research & Analysis</p14></center> <br><br>
      <p7>The first half of the project was spent conducting research to understand loneliness, how it affects people in their everyday lives, and how they cope.
        We used three different methods to gather the data we needed to solve this problem: <b>survey</b>, <b>time diary</b>, and <b>follow-up interview</b>.
      <br><br>

      <p3>Survey</p3>
      <br><br>
      <p7>In order to find appropriate participants for the next steps in the research process as well as structure our diary study, we surveyed 21 students at five
        universities. We asked about demographic information, their current social environments, and four main questions about their loneliness levels.</p7>

      <br><br>
      <center><img src="img/connectpage/chart 1 n 2.png" style="width:100%"></center>
      <br><br>

      <p3>Time Diary Study</p3>
      <br><br>
      <p7>Loneliness is a difficult feeling to track, so in order to identify the moments our users felt lonely we had conducted a time diary study with 10 participants.
        It lasted one week and included 4 daily check-ins where we asked the user to fill out the activities, they had completed during that particular time slot and
        record their loneliness levels during those activities on a scale from 0 to 10 (0 being not lonely and 10 being the highest feelings of loneliness).

        <br><br>

        We analyzed over 200 responses and discovered that the highest levels of loneliness were recorded when participants were using various streaming entertainment services.
      </p7>

      <br><br>

      </div>
      <br><br>
<div class = "main">
      <p3>Debrief Interview</p3>
      <br><br>
      <p7>
      In order to gain more insight into the ratings each participant gave, we conducted debrief interviews. Using the time diary responses from each participant, personalized
      questions were formulated about each activity and what triggered their loneliness in that moment. We discussed:
      <br>


      <ul>
        <li>Their highest loneliness activities</li>
        <li>Their coping methods for loneliness</li>
        <li>Activities where they felt the least lonely</li>
        <li>Their responses to the initial screener survey questions</li>
        <li>If there are any services that they wish were available to them on or off campus to help cope with loneliness</li>
        <li>Their response to our questions about counseling services in the initial screener survey</li>
      </ul>

      <br>

      After the interviews and a total data analysis was complete, it became clear that there were three common triggers of loneliness and three common coping mechanisms.
      </p7>
      <br><br>

      <center><img src="img/connectpage/triggerquote.png" style="width:100%"></center>
      <br><br>

      <p3>Personas</p3>
      <br><br>
      <p7>We built two personas based on the data gathered. These personas helped our team in the ideation stage of design.</p7>
      <br><br>

      <center>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="column">
            <img src="img/connectpage/KarenPersona.jpg" style="width:100%">
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <img src="img/connectpage/CameronPersona.jpg" style="width:100%">
          </div>
        </div>
      </center>

      <br><br>
      <center><p14>Design</p14></center> <br><br>
      <p7>Our design process began with brainstorming ideas based on the triggers and coping mechanisms of our users and resulted in a total of 60 sketches.
        To narrow down and make a final decision on the design we wanted to move forward with, we used the dot voting method.

      <br><br>
      Ultimately, we chose to create a collaborative show watching experience because we believed this would be a unique way to connect people with each
      other despite distance.
      </p7>

      <br><br>

      <p3>Low Fidelity Prototype</p3>
      <br><br>
      <p7>When we began working on our low fidelity prototype, we decided that we wanted to achieve the following goals through our design:
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li>Creating an intuitive experience with great learnability potential</li>
          <li>Making it easy for people to connect with their friends</li>
          <li>Have the ability to fully customize their experience without it feeling overwhelming with too many options</li>
        </ol>
        <br>

        With those goals in mind we went to the whiteboard and mapped out the important features we would need to create a finished project
        that met those objectives and translated it to a design.
      </p7>

      <br><br>

      <p3>Usability Testing</p3>
      <br><br>
      <p7>After building out the paper prototype, we performed a pilot test and three-hour long usability tests to receive feedback on our
        initial design, identify pain points, and make necessary improvements.</p7>

      <br><br>

      <p3>Wireframes</p3>
      <br><br>
      <p7>Using the updated paper prototype, we translated our design into wireframes and eventually a high-fidelity prototype. </p7>

      <br><br>

      <p7>Our main goal was to design a calming and comfortable experience which was reflected in the calming blue colors of our color palette. <p7>
