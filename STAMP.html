				<h3> STAMP Event Discovery </h3>
					<br><br>
					<p4> The Adele H. Stamp Student Union (STAMP) is the student activity 
					center at the University of Maryland. It aims to nurture a welcoming 
					and inclusive community through events, resources, and 
					intentional programming. With over <p24>3,000</p24> events happening in and 
					around the building each year, it is nearly impossible to keep students 
					in the loop. Conversely, students have a hard time finding events that 
					interest them. </p4>

						<p5> Client: Eva Quintos Tennant, Assistant Director of Marketing and Communications at STAMP 
						<br><br>
						Team Members: Kaushalya Ganesh, Dawson Hoppes, Ashrith Shetty </p5>

				<h4> The Challenge </h4>
					<br><br>
					<p6> How can students connect? </p6>
						<br><br>
						<p8> The university is home to 40,000+ students who have a wide range of social 
						media preferences, interests, and habits. It is becoming increasingly difficult 
						for the marketing and communications department to effectively communicate and 
						engage with the community. 
						
						<br><br>
						
						Despite having a dedicated website, the departments of STAMP use various channels 
						of communication (social media, email newsletters, etc.) and none to their best 
						potential. We felt the need to assist STAMP Marketing in finding ways to improve 
						their platforms of communication. A semester-long user research project was 
						conducted to understand how students discover & track events that take place at 
						the University, specifically focusing on those that take place in STAMP. </p8>

						<br><br><br>
						
							<p7> Project Inspiration </p7>
						
							<br><br><br>
							<p8>
							As students at the University of Maryland, our research team is in and around 
							STAMP at least 4-5 times a week, and we still felt like we were unprepared and 
							unknowledgeable of the events happening around us.
						
							<br><br>
						
							Through talking with other students we found that the website was hard to navigate,
							and did not easily present relevant information about upcoming events.
							</p8>
						
						<br><br><br>
						
							<p7> Initial Assumptions </p7>
						
							<br><br><br>
							<p8>
							Based off of our initial contact with other students and our personal experiences, 
							we thought it best to focus our efforts on the problems with the STAMP website.
							</p8>
						
						<br><br><br>
						
							<p7> Client Meeting </p7>
						
							<br><br><br>
							<p8> <img src="img/STAMPpage/clientmeeting.jpg" style="width:50%;height:50%;margin-left:15px;">
							We presented our problem statement and initial assumptions to our client. 
							Through this meeting we learned that the initial scope of our project was too 
							narrow.

							<br><br>
							
							While the website is a resource some students use, the vast majority find out 
							about events through alternative channels. We were asked to discover which
							channels were most effective, and where there was room for improvement in the 
							marketing team's strategies.
							
							</p8>
						
						<br><br><br>
						
							<p7> Project Focus </p7>
						
							<br><br><br>
							<p8>
								<ul>
									<li>Evaluate the existing pain points of the STAMP 
										event discovery experience and discover additional breakdowns</li>
									<li>Meet with students to learn more about 
										the channels they actually use to find events</li>
									<li>Identify the most effective communication 
										channels for STAMP to pursue in the future</li> 
								</ul>
								<br><br><br><br>

			<h4> The Research Method </h4>
				<br><br>
				<p6> Contextual Inquiry </p6>
					<br><br>
					<p8>
					Through the contextual design process, we aimed to discover new 
					insights into the way students find events, and propose the best 
					ways for the marketing team to reach their audience. </p8>
						<ul>
							<li>Since our goal was to improve the experience of students 
							across campus, we decided to interview students that 
							represented the following groups:
								<ul>
									<li>Develop initial project assumptions</li>
									<li>Meet with client</li>
									<li>Refine project focus</li> 
									<li>Conducted contextual inquiries</li>
									<li>Interview interpretation sessions</li>
									<li>Helped build various models (i.e. affinity diagram, day in the life, sequence)</li>
									<li>Designed product concepts based off team research</li>
									<li>Developed final client presentation</li>

					<br><br><br>
					
					<ul>
							<li>During our interviews we primarily focused on gathering 
							data about the following:
								<ul>
									<li>How do students learn about upcoming events?</li>
									<li>What social media channels do they interact with?</li>
									<li>What do students typically go to STAMP for?</li> 
									<li>Do they attend events alone or with others?</li>
									<li>What type of events do they attend?</li>
									<li>Where do they keep track of information about 
										upcoming events they are interested in?</li>
									<li>Observe how students use their choice of social 
										media for event finding</li>
									<li>Observe how students navigate the STAMP website 
										to find an event</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
						
					
					<br><br><br>
					
						<p6> Data Interpretation </p6>
					
						<br><br><br>
						<p8>
						Twenty-four to forty-eight hours after each interview was conducted, 
						an interpretation session subsequently occurred. The purpose of these 
						sessions was to share and analyze the insights gathered during each 
						interview across the team. This ensured that everyone was aware of any 
						issues and could continue to work toward the common goal.
					
						</p8>
					
					<br><br><br>
					
						<p7> Affinity Diagram </p7>
					
						<br><br><br>
						<p8>
						After the conclusion of eight interviews and interpretation sessions,
						we started the process of building our affinity diagram. The purpose of 
						our affinity diagram was to show the scope of the problem and reveal 
						the issues, worries, and key elements of the users' lives relevant to 
						our focus in one place.
						
						<br><br>
						
						The first step was to take our notes from the interviews and place 
						them in the wall, putting notes with similar ideas in columns together. 
						</p8>
						
						<br><br><br>
						
						<!-- Photo Grid -->
						<div class="row1"> 
						  <div class="column1">
							<img src="img/STAMPpage/affinity2.jpg" style="width:100%">
							<img src="img/STAMPpage/affinity1.jpg" style="width:100%">
							
						  </div>
						  <div class="column1">
							<img src="img/STAMPpage/affinity4.jpg" style="width:100%">
							<img src="img/STAMPpage/affinity3.jpg" style="width:100%">
						  </div>  
						</div> 
					<br><br><br>
					
						<p8>
						After we broke the original groupings down to smaller groups, 
						our next step was to create blue notes that captured the theme 
						of the yellow notes.							
						</p8>
					
					<br><br><br>
					
					<!-- Photo Grid -->
						<div class="row1"> 
						  <div class="column1">
							<img src="img/STAMPpage/affinity6.jpg" style="width:100%">
						  </div>
						  <div class="column1">
							<img src="img/STAMPpage/affinity5.jpg" style="width:100%">
						  </div>  
						</div> 
						  
						  <div align="center">
							<img src="img/STAMPpage/affinity7.jpg" style="width:99%">
						  </div>
						  
					<br><br><br>
					
						<p8>
						Next, we created pink notes that described the big picture 
						idea that a group of blue notes below was about.							
						</p8>
						
					<br><br><br>
					
						<p8>
						When we felt confident that our pink notes were good and 
						described the themes well, we moved on to creating green notes 
						that grouped the sections under the pink note and gave us 
						overarching themes and ultimately told a story about our users 
						and their various experiences.							
						</p8>
						
						<br><br><br>
						
						<div align="center" >

						<br><br><br>
						
						<p7> Day in the life model </p7>
						
						<br><br><br>
						
						<p8>
						During each interpretation session we created separate models 
						for each interviewee and then consolidated them. The purpose of 
						creating a day in the life model was to graphically show how 
						users accomplish the task of finding certain events. We wanted 
						to understand how the users move through their world, what they 
						do in different places, what devices they use to get things done, 
						and how they access the content they need.</p8>
					
						<br><br><br>
						
						<div align="center" >
							<img src="img/STAMPpage/DayintheLife.jpg" style="width:99%">
						</div>
						
						<br><br><br>
						
						<p7> Sequence Model </p7>
						
						<br><br><br>
						
						<p8>
						During each interpretation session, sequence models were built 
						to capture the triggers, intents, and steps of each user's event 
						finding process through their various channels. These diagrams 
						helped define the scenarios of use that our product design must 
						support and identify lower-level usability issues.
						
						<br>
						
						They were later consolidated into one sequence model to drive 
						detailed design (click image to get a closer look).

				<h4> The Design Process </h4>
					<br><br>
					<p6> Visioning </p6>
						
						<br><br><br>
						
							<p8>
							In order to start the visioning process, our team did a wall walk 
							of our affinity diagram to give us a chance to review the story 
							that was crafted from the interview data. It gave us a chance to 
							see the whole scope of the data and consider the best way to respond 
							with a coherent design solution.
 						
							<br><br>
						
							Each person silently reviewed the data and wrote design ideas on 
							hot pink sticky notes along the way.
							
							</p8>
							
							<br><br><br>
						  
							<!-- Photo Grid -->
							<div class="row1"> 
							  <div class="column1">

							<div align="center">
							<img src="img/STAMPpage/wallwalk3.jpg" style="width:99%">
							</div>
						
						<br><br><br>
						
						
							<p8>
							Next, we created a list of all of our ideas and divided them into 
							two sections &ndash; issues and hot ideas. Then we chose five ideas from 
							the list that we decided should be our main focus and turned them 
							into design concepts during our visioning session. These concepts were:
							</p8>
							
							<ol>
								<li>Facebook Ads</li>
								<li>Foodcourt Banners</li>
								<li>Personalized Newsletters</li> 
								<li>Add to Calendar</li>
								<li>Poster QR Codes</li>

		<h4> Product concepts </h4>
							
			<br><br><br>
			
			<p6> Facebook Ads </p6>
		
			<br><br><br>
			<p8> <img src="img/STAMPpage/facebookad.jpg" style="width:40%;height:40%;margin-left:15px;">
			Throughout all the interviews, Facebook was a common social media platform used by 
			students to find and track their events. Due to the fact that it is such a highly 
			used application and an integral part of many users lives, we believed that 
			targeted facebook ads will allow the STAMP marketing team to reach a broader 
			audience. This is a relatively low cost feature on Facebook, which would 
			allow the team to send out event promo to target user groups.
			
			</p8>
		
		<br><br><br>
		
			<p6> Poster qr codes </p6>
		
			<br><br><br>
			<p8>
				STAMP's major form of advertisement are their numerous posters that are 
				seen around the building as well as throughout campus. Many users indicated 
				that they are engaged by the posters and rely on them to find out about events. 
				Students tend to take photos of the posters to save the information and/or to 
				look up the details later. We decided to capitalize on that aspect by suggesting 
				the addition of QR codes to the posters that connect to the event's Facebook page. 
				This allows for quick and easy access to events as well as the means to interact 
				with the event on the largely used social media form.
			</p8>
			
			<br><br>
			
				<img src="img/STAMPpage/poster.jpg" style="width:80%">
				
			<br><br><br>
		
			<p6> Foodcourt Banners </p6>
		
			<br><br><br>
			<p8>
				STAMP is the central hub for many students and one of the main reasons students 
				enter the building is to go to the food court. Various users noted that while in 
				the building they see many advertisements and take note of various events occurring. 
				Currently there is little to no advertising in the food court and believe that by adding 
				large banners in the main seating area of the food court we can attract more attention 
				to upcoming events.
			</p8>
			
			<br><br>
			
				<img src="img/STAMPpage/foodcourtbanner.jpg" style="width:100%">
				
			<br><br><br>
		
			<p6> Personalized Newsletters </p6>
		
			<br><br><br>
			<p8>
				We found that a lot of students use email as a way to receive event information 
				from various organizations. However, emails are not currently personalized and 
				a lot of students get bombarded with mail that is irrelevant to them. In an effort 
				to save their inboxes and help STAMP target specific groups, we proposed an opt 
				out system where students have the ability to select the topics they are interested 
				in and simply receive event emails on those topics.
				</p8>
			
			<br><br>
			
				<img src="img/STAMPpage/listserve.jpg" style="width:100%">
				
			<br><br><br>
		
			<p6> Add to Calendar </p6>
		
			<br><br><br>
			<p8>
				Many users indicated that an add to calendar button was helpful on other 
				sites and wished they had that ability on the STAMP calendar site. Although 
				this option is available it is difficult to find. We wanted to make it more 
				accessible to the user directly on the events and programs page. Once the user 
				clicks the button an .ics file is dowloaded and the event is added to their 
				personal calendar.

				<h4> Final Client Meeting </h4>
					<br><br><br>
						
							<p8>
							Our final step in the user research process was to report our 
							findings and product concepts to our client. We conducted a board 
							room presentation with Eva Quintos Tennant, the Assistant Director 
							of Marketing and Communications, as well as the Graphic Design and 
							Marketing Coordinators of STAMP.

			<h4> Next Steps </h4>
				<br><br><br>
					
						<p8>
						Our presentation and ideas were well received by our audience. Although 
						they knew about the increase in traffic on Facebook, they were not fully 
						aware that it has become somewhat of an event management tool instead of a 
						social media platform for most students. They plan on sharing the information, 
						especially in regards to the importance of capitalizing on Facebook, with the 
						11 other STAMP teams as well as the Director. 
						
						<br><br>
						
						I look forward to seeing how these solutions can be implemented to make a true 
						impact on the student's experience as well as STAMP Marketing's effectiveness as 
						a whole.
