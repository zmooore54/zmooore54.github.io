				<h4 style="text-align:center"> The Design Problem </h4>
				<br>
				<p4 style ="text-align:center"> The university is home to 40,000+ students who have
				a wide range of interests, habits, and social media preferences. It has become
				increasingly difficult for the marketing and communications department to effectively
				communicate and engage with the student body.

				<br><br>

				Despite having a dedicated website, STAMP departments use various channels of
				communication (social media, email newsletters, etc.) but none to their full potential. </p4>

				<br><br>
				<hr align="center" width="90%" color=" #4A4A4A">
				<br><br>

				<h4> Project Inspiration </h4>
					<br>
					<p4>
					As students of the University of Maryland, our research team frequents STAMP throughout
					the week, and we still felt like we were unprepared and unaware of the events happening around us.
					Through talking with fellow students, we discovered that the website was difficult to navigate,
					and did not intuitively present relevant information about upcoming events.

					<br><br>

					Subsequently, we offered our services to the STAMP Marketing department in finding ways to improve
					their channels of communication. A semester-long user research project was conducted to understand
					how students discover & track events that take place at the University, specifically focusing on those
					that take place in STAMP.
					</p4>
				<br><br>

				<h4> The Process </h4>

			<h4>Pre-Research</h4>
			<br>

			<p6> Initial Assumptions </p6>

				<br>
				<p4>
				Based off of our initial contact with other students and our personal experiences,
				we thought it best to focus our efforts on the problems with the STAMP website.
				</p4>

			<br><br>

			<p6> Client Meeting </p6>

			<br>
			<p4>
			We presented our problem statement and initial assumptions to the client. During this
			interview, we learned that the initial scope of our project was too narrow.
			<br><br>
			While the website is a resource some students use, the vast majority find out about
			events through alternative channels. We were asked to discover which channels were most effective, and where there was room for improvement in the marketing team's strategies.
			</p4>

			<br><br>
			<p6> Project Focus </p6>
				<ul>
					<li>Evaluate the existing pain points of the STAMP
						event discovery experience and identify additional breakdowns</li>
					<li>Meet with students to learn more about
						the channels they actually use to find events</li>
					<li>Identify the most effective communication
						channels for STAMP to pursue in the future</li>
				</ul>

		<br><br>
		<hr align="center" width="90%" color=" #4A4A4A">
		<br><br>

		 <h4>Pre-Research</h4>
		 <br>

			<p6> Contextual Inquiry </p6>

			<br>

		 	<p4>Through the contextual design process, we aimed to discover new
			insights into the way students find events and propose the best
			ways for the marketing team to reach their audience.

			<br><br>

			Since our goal was to improve the experience of students
			across campus, we decided to interview students that represented the
			following groups: </p4>
				<ul>
					<li>Underclassmen</li>
					<li>Upperclassmen</li>
					<li>Graduate Students</li>
					<li>On-Campus (1/2mi radius)</li>
					<li>Off-Campus</li>
					<li>International</li>
					<li>Domestic</li>
				</ul>

			<br><br>

			<p4>During our interviews we primarily focused on gathering data about the following:</p4>
				<ul>
					<li>How do students learn about upcoming events?</li>
					<li>What social media channels do they interact with?</li>
					<li>What do students typically go to STAMP for?</li>
					<li>Do they attend events alone or with others?</li>
					<li>What type of events do they attend?</li>
					<li>Where do they keep track of information about
						upcoming events they are interested in?</li>
					<li>Observe how students use their choice of social
						media for event finding</li>
					<li>Observe how students navigate the STAMP website
						to find an event</li>
				</ul>

			<br><br>

			<p6> Data Interpretation </p6>

			<br>
			<p4>Twenty-four to forty-eight hours after each contextual inquiry interview was conducted,
			 an interpretation session was conducted. The purpose of the sessions was to share and analyze
			 the insights gathered during each interview across the team. This ensured common knowledge
			 throughout the team, allowed anyone to raise any questions or concerns, and enabled us to
			 continue working toward the common goal. </p4>

			 <br><br>

			 	<p7>Affinity Diagram</p7>
			 	<br>
			 		<p4>
					After the conclusion of eight interviews and interpretation sessions, we started
					the process of building the affinity diagram. Its purpose was to show the scope of
					the problem and reveal the user’s pain points in one visual diagram.

					<br><br>

					The first step was to take our notes from the interviews and place
					them on the wall, placing notes with similar ideas in the same column.
					</p4>

					<br><br><br>

					<!-- Photo Grid -->
					<div class="row1">
					  <div class="column1">
						<img src="img/STAMPpage/affinity2.jpg" style="width:100%">
						<img src="img/STAMPpage/affinity1.jpg" style="width:100%">

					  </div>
					  <div class="column1">
						<img src="img/STAMPpage/affinity4.jpg" style="width:100%">
						<img src="img/STAMPpage/affinity3.jpg" style="width:100%">
					  </div>
					</div>
				<br><br><br>

					<p4>
					After we broke the original groupings down to smaller groups of the closest
					related notes, our next step was to create blue notes that captured the theme
					of the yellow notes.
					</p4>

				<br><br><br>

				<!-- Photo Grid -->
					<div class="row1">
					  <div class="column1">
						<img src="img/STAMPpage/affinity6.jpg" style="width:100%">
					  </div>
					  <div class="column1">
						<img src="img/STAMPpage/affinity5.jpg" style="width:100%">
					  </div>
					</div>

					  <div align="center">
						<img src="img/STAMPpage/affinity7.jpg" style="width:99%">
					  </div>

				<br><br><br>

					<p4>
					Next, we created pink notes that described the big picture that a
					group of blue notes below was about.
					</p4>

				<br><br><br>

					<p4>
					When we felt confident that our pink notes described the themes well, we
					moved on to creating green notes that grouped the sections under the pink
					note and gave us overarching themes and ultimately told a story about our
					users and their various experiences.
					</p4>

					<br><br><br>

					<div align="center" >
						<img src="img/STAMPpage/affinity9.jpg" style="width:99%">
					</div>

					<br><br><br>

					<p7> Day in the life model </p7>

					<br>

					<p4>
						During each interpretation session we created separate models for each interviewee
						and then consolidated them. The purpose of creating a day in the life model was to
						graphically show how users accomplish the task of finding certain events. We wanted to
						understand how the users navigate their world, what they do in different places, what
						devices they use to get things done, and how they access the content they need.</p4>

						<br><br><br>

						<div align="center" >
							<img src="img/STAMPpage/DayintheLife.png" style="width:99%">
						</div>

						<br><br><br>

						<p7> Sequence Model </p7>

						<br>

						<p4>
						During each interpretation session, sequence models were built to capture the triggers,
						intents, and steps of each user's event finding process through the various channels they use.
						These diagrams helped define the scenarios of use that our product design must support and
						identify lower-level usability issues.

						<br>

						The individual models were consolidated into one sequence model to drive detailed design.
						</p4>

						<br><br><br>

							<img src="img/STAMPpage/Sequence Model.jpg" style="width:70%">

				<hr align="center" width="90%" color=" #4A4A4A">
				<br><br>

			<h4>Design</h4>
			<br>
			<p6> Visioning </p6>

			<br>

				<p4>
				To kick-off the visioning process, our team did a wall walk of our affinity diagram
				to provide us with the opportunity to review the story that was crafted from the interview
				data. It gave us a chance to see the whole scope of the data and consider the best way to
				respond with coherent design solutions.

				<br><br>

				Each person silently reviewed the data and wrote design ideas on hot pink sticky notes along the way.

				</p4>

				<br><br><br>

				<!-- Photo Grid -->
				<div class="row1">
				  <div class="column1">
					<img src="img/STAMPpage/wallwalk1.jpg" style="width:100%">
				  </div>
				  <div class="column1">
					<img src="img/STAMPpage/wallwalk2.jpg" style="width:100%">
				  </div>
				</div>

				<div align="center">
				<img src="img/STAMPpage/wallwalk3.jpg" style="width:99%">
				</div>

			<br><br><br>


				<p4>
				Next, we created a list of all of our ideas and divided them into
				two sections &ndash; issues and hot ideas. Then we chose five ideas from
				the list that we decided should be our main focus and turned them
				into design concepts during our visioning session. These concepts were:
				</p4>

				<ol>
					<li>Facebook Ads</li>
					<li>Food Court Banners</li>
					<li>Personalized Newsletters</li>
					<li>Add to Calendar</li>
					<li>Poster QR Codes</li>
				</ol>

			<br><br>
			<p6> Product Concepts </p6>

			<br>

			<left><p7> Facebook Ads </p7></left>

			<br>
			<p4> <img src="img/STAMPpage/facebookad.jpg" style="width:40%;height:40%;margin-left:15px;">
			Throughout all the interviews, Facebook was a common social media platform used by
			students to find and track their events. Due to the fact that it is such a highly
			used application and an integral part of many users lives, we believed that
			targeted facebook ads will allow the STAMP marketing team to reach a broader
			audience. This is a relatively low cost feature on Facebook, which would
			allow the team to send out event promo to target user groups.

			</p4>

		<br><br><br>

			<p7> Poster QR Codes </p7>

			<br>
			<p4>
				STAMP's major form of advertisement are their numerous posters that are
				seen around the building as well as throughout campus. Many users indicated
				that they are engaged by the posters and rely on them to find out about events.
				Students tend to take photos of the posters to save the information and/or to
				look up the details later. We decided to capitalize on that aspect by suggesting
				the addition of QR codes to the posters that connect to the event's Facebook page.
				This allows for quick and easy access to events as well as the means to interact
				with the event on the largely used social media form.
			</p4>

			<br><br>

				<img src="img/STAMPpage/poster.jpg" style="width:90%">

			<br><br><br>

			<p7> Foodcourt Banners </p7>

			<br>
			<p4>
				STAMP is the central hub for many students and one of the main reasons students
				enter the building is to go to the food court. Various users noted that while in
				the building they see many advertisements and take note of various events occurring.
				Currently there is little to no advertising in the food court and believe that by adding
				large banners in the main seating area of the food court we can attract more attention
				to upcoming events.
			</p4>

			<br><br>

				<img src="img/STAMPpage/foodcourtbanner.jpg" style="width:100%">

			<br><br><br>

			<p7> Personalized Newsletters </p7>

			<br>
			<p4>
				We found that a lot of students use email as a way to receive event information
				from various organizations. However, emails are not currently personalized, and
				a lot of students get bombarded with mail that is irrelevant to them. In an effort
				to save their inboxes and help STAMP target specific groups, we proposed an opt
				out system where students have the ability to select the topics they are interested
				in and simply receive event emails on those topics.
				</p4>

			<br><br>

				<img src="img/STAMPpage/listserve.jpg" style="width:100%">

			<br><br><br>

			<p7> Add to Calendar </p7>

			<br>
			<p4>
				Many users indicated that an add to calendar button was helpful on other
				sites and wished they had that ability on the STAMP calendar site. Although
				this option is available it is difficult to find. We wanted to make it more
				accessible to the user directly on the events and programs page. Once the user
				clicks the button an .ics file is downloaded and the event is added to their
				personal calendar.
			</p4>

			<br><br>

			<h4> Final Client Meeting </h4>
			<br>
				<p4>
				Our final step in the user research process was to report our
				findings and product concepts to our client. We conducted a board
				room presentation with Eva Quintos Tennant, the Assistant Director
				of Marketing and Communications, as well as the Graphic Design and
				Marketing Coordinators of STAMP.
